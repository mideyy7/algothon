IMCITY CHALLENGE13Trading London
14
Trade the Pulse of the City
Forget backtests and static datasets.
In the IMCity London Challenge, you’ll be trading real-world signals in real time
not simulations, not hypotheticals:
LONDON ETF:
Thames water level, trade intraday water activity
London Heathrow airport activity, surging and dipping through the day.
London Weather data, influencing energy and movement.
No pre-programmed datasets.
No artificial market feeds.
No design that always know tomorrow.
Each data point is a heartbeat of the city; every fluctuation is an opportunity. Settlement price is 
unknown. For now.
Can your model keep up with reality?Trading London
15
Watch London’s data come alive
Thames levels, temperature, and flight arrivals 
updating in real time.
See metrics shift intraday, and track your 
position on the leaderboard  as markets react.
Every fluctuation moves prices; every trade 
changes the ranking.

CMI EXCHANGE & APITrading London
17
We built our own trading exchange, modelled after real markets.
You’ll see live order books, bid–ask spreads, and market depth, all driven by London’s data.
Trade directly through the web interface, or connect your algorithms via our API to stream data, 
send orders, and manage positions.
This design is mimicking full-scale electronic trading. You’ll be coding, debugging, optimizing, 
just like you would on a real trading desk at IMC Trading.
Your logic! Your algo’s! Your edge?CMI & API
•
 Shows order prices at which market 
participants are willing to buy (bid) or sell (ask)
•
 Orders express believes about a tradable 
quantity: buy 
 -
> too low, sell 
 -
> too high
•
 A new order that crosses resting orders in the 
book gets executed at the best possible price for 
the aggressor → 
Price/Time priority
•
 When a new order crosses existing ones, it is 
   
 
 immediately executed

2.
 • No collusion or coordinated trading between teams
3.
 • Keep API usage efficient 
 —

1.
 We will settle all products at the end of the trading round. For each 
 productGroup  
where you have 
positive 
 PnL
 , we normalize your 
 PnL  
by the sum of all positive 
 PnLs  
across teams in that product.
2.
 This makes each product’s group’ score a percentage share of the achievable 
 PnL
 .
3.
 Teams with losses will see their score be normalized against all other teams with negative 
 PnL
 , We 
have 5 product Groups: 
       
 A) Market 1,3,5 & 7, B) Market 2, C) Market 4, D) Market 6, E) Market 8
Product Group A points will be multiplied by 4 (Given we have 4 products in there)
4.
 Your final total score is the sum of all product scores, which is derived from the obtained 
 PnL  
based 
on your trading. Any leftover position is sold/bought by our system at the settlement price.
